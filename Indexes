Indexing is a way to call values into a file later on, simply by refrencing a defined index
In this situation we desribed a few variables, then called them in a print script.

```
eggs = 'great'
AWS_TARGET_REGION = 'us-east-1'
SOURCE_ROUTE_TABLE_ID = 'rt-xxxxxxx'


		'routeTableID=$(aws ec2 create-route-table --region {0} --vpc-id {1} --output text | grep "^ROUTETABLE" | cut -f2)\n' \
		'echo "Route table: $routeTableID"\n'.format(
			AWS_TARGET_REGION,
			SOURCE_ROUTE_TABLE_ID
	))
  ```
